            This project started as an experiment to discover if web
            technologies could be used to create an effective platform for
            language learning. I worked closely with language tutors and
            students to design and build an initial prototype application with
            which students are able to record phrases they&apos;ve learnt, and
            be tested on them through interactive exercises.

          <p>
            The initial version was a utilitarian, minimal, and form-focused
            interface which many users found difficult to comprehend and engage
            with. After several months of qualitative research through user
            interviews and feedback, I pivoted the application to be centred
            around a virtual Parrot character that users teach new words and
            phrases to. Although functionally the same at its core, this design
            decision made the application&apos;s functionality feel less
            abstract and easier to learn for many users. This change resulting
            in an increase in daily active users, 9 to 52.

            Currently, the application is in an open beta testing phase, and Iâ€™m
            collecting data and analytics on a number of key research topics
            that will drive the next phase of the product&apos;s development.
            The goal is to refine the user experience, improve the curriculum
            and progression, and optimize the speech recognition and tracking of
            a user&apos;s language learning progress over time.
