            This project focused on identifying individuals, groups or
            organisations that have a responsibility for security without it
            being their day job. Early exploration led to software engineers and
            product engineering organisations. They represent a wide addressable
            market with a responsibility to ensure the applications and products
            they ship are secure.

              I can’t go into too many details about this project at the moment,
              but I can say it has seen me undertake the following activities:
            </p>
            <li>
              Planning and facilitating generative interviews with ~30
              participants across different roles within product engineering
              organisations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lead a team of designers, product managers and engineers through a
              rapid discovery and design sprint process.
            </li>
            <li>
              Running empathy mapping and task modelling workshops to identify
              common patterns and opportunities for improved application
              security posture.
            </li>
            <li>
              Full stack prototyping with Python and TypeScript, building APIs
              and microservices that interact with Large Language Models (Open
              AI, Anthropic).
            </li>
          </ul>
