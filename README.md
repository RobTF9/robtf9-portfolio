  My portfolio website

Built with React, Gatsby and animated with React Spring. I use Netlify CMS to store all my projects. Feel free to play around, I'm always looking for feedback on how I can improve my work.

## 🚀 To start

1.  **Yarn**

    I used yarn as my package manager. Use the yarn command in the terminal to install all dependencies.
    
    ```sh
      cd my-default-starter/
      yarn
    ```
    
    
1.  **Start developing.**

    Start using the yarn start command. I've also added a "yarn pull-content" command if you have made updates on the CMS this will pull down the content changes and refresh the cache, avoiding issues with gatsby-image.

    ```sh
    yarn start
    ```
    or
    ```sh
    yarn pull-content
    ```
