  PIDSA (Panasonic Industrial Devices Sales Company Of America) had an outdated,
  non-responsive website that was scaling poorly as their business required more
  advanced features. Within a short time frame and limited budget we delivered a
  scalable, responsive design system and headless front end application that has
  allowed PIDSA to implement industry leading features with ease.
