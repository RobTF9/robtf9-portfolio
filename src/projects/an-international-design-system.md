  Parametric searches are typically a mess of cluttered interface components and
  unreadable data. I designed, user tested and prototyped a fully reponsive
  solution for Panasonic America that strips away the complexity and provides
  users with an easy way to configure and refine the parameters of their search.

      As we already had an established design system I iteratively prototyped my
      ideas with wireframes to get faster feedback from users, the dev team and
      the client.

      Very few exsisting parametric searches are responsive. My solution works
      seemlessly across all devices.
